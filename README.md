# Project 1: GIS + Causal Inference in Education Policy at Chicago
An Evaluation of Illinois’s Evidence-Based Funding Education Policy on Student Performance and District Financial Health

Overview
This repository contains an analytical project evaluating the impact of Illinois’s Evidence-Based Funding (EBF) policy on student academic performance and district financial health, conducted by Rui (Chris) Chen and Xinyue Zhou at the Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago.

Project Overview

This research investigates two main questions:

How has the EBF policy implemented in 2017 affected student performance (ELA and Math) and district financial health?

Does the EBF policy improve student performance indirectly through its effects on district financial health?

The analysis covers data from 2015 to 2019, offering insights into both direct and indirect effects of funding policies.

Methodology

The analysis includes both statistical and spatial approaches:

Statistical Analysis:

Panel Regression Analysis: Evaluating the direct effect of the EBF policy on student performance (ELA & Math).

Financial Health Mediation Analysis: Assessing how district financial scores mediate the impact of the EBF policy on student performance.

Spatial Analysis:

GIS Visualization: Using QGIS for mapping educational performance and financial scores across Illinois.

Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA): Conducted with GeoDa to identify spatial patterns of educational performance and financial conditions across districts.

Data Sources

Illinois Board of Education: Evidence-based funding data covering 3,767 public schools and 325 districts from 2015 to 2019.

Illinois Report Card (PARCC): District-level proficiency rates in ELA and Math.

School District Financial Profiles: Comprehensive financial scores based on metrics like liquidity, debt, and expenditure-to-revenue ratios.

Socioeconomic Indicators: Free lunch counts as proxies for district socioeconomic status from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

5Essentials® Survey Data: Organizational conditions impacting school effectiveness.

National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): School District Finance Survey data.

Tools Used

R: Data cleaning, merging, and statistical regression analysis.

QGIS: Spatial data visualization and mapping.

GeoDa: Spatial autocorrelation and Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) analyses.

Key Findings

The EBF policy significantly improved student performance in ELA and Math post-implementation, although improvements were modest.

Financial health improvements due to EBF were positive but limited in economic significance.

A small but positive mediation effect of district financial health on student performance was observed.

Spatial analysis showed mixed alignment between funding distribution and student performance, highlighting localized discrepancies.

Limitations & Future Research

Limited timeframe (2015-2019) restricts the identification of long-term impacts.

School-level data granularity could further enhance understanding of heterogeneous effects.

Future research should consider longer observation periods and utilize more granular spending data to refine causal inference.
